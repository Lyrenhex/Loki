# Loki
The trickster ~~god~~ bot, for all your friend group's memetic
Discord server needs.

## Limitations

This is a personal project intended specifically for one of my
friend groups' servers; whilst it's intended to be implemented
reasonably generically, features themselves are tailored to that
server (alone).

## Planned features

- [x] Command to explain my Discord status.
    - [x] Management command so that the bot owner can update the
          response to this.
- [ ] Nickname auto-changer lottery
- [ ] Responses to specific text in messages (but not actual commands)
- [ ] Periodic checks for how many known issues are present in FH5
and compares to the same list for GT7. Output in number of pages.
- [ ] "Meme of the week"
    - Watches a memes channel, keeping a record of each meme posted.
    - Pings a reminder on Friday if no memes are present that week.
    - Opens votes (some kind of poll) for meme of the week on
      Saturday.
        - This is also when the week resets.
    - Winning meme announced when polls open for the next week.

Eventually roll [ThreadReviver](https://github.com/Lyrenhex/ThreadReviver)'s behaviour into Loki.

## Credits

This is a personal project. That said, there are code snippets either
heavily inspired by (or modified versions of) code from
[parrot](https://github.com/aquelemiguel/parrot).

Many thanks to their contributors!
